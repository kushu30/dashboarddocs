# Orders

The **Orders page** in FlexyPe provides a complete list of all orders placed in your store. This view consolidates order information, customer details, payment status, and timestamps—allowing you to stay on top of your fulfilment process and manage transactions seamlessly.

## Key Features

### Order List
Every order is listed with a unique **Order ID**, customer information, and essential details. You can click on the Order ID to open the order in your Shopify admin for further action.

### Customer Information
For each order, you can view the customer’s name, email, and phone number. This helps you verify orders and communicate directly with the customer if required.

### Amount & Payment Mode
See the exact value of each order along with the payment method chosen—whether Cash on Delivery (COD), UPI, Card, or Netbanking.

### Payment Status
Orders are labeled with their payment status, such as:
- **Pending** – Awaiting confirmation.  
- **Paid** – Successfully completed.  
- **Failed** – Payment attempt unsuccessful.  
- **Refunded** – Amount returned to the customer.  

These statuses provide immediate clarity on the state of each transaction.

### Date & Time
Each order displays the exact date and time it was created, helping you track recent activity and order flow.

## Why It Matters

The Orders page is the backbone of your daily operations. It ensures you always know:
- Which orders need attention.  
- The current payment state of each order.  
- Who your customers are and how to reach them.  

By centralizing this information, FlexyPe makes order management efficient, transparent, and reliable.
