# COD Settings

The **COD Settings** module under the RTO Suite allows you to manage and restrict Cash on Delivery orders. This helps reduce **Return-to-Origin (RTO) risks** by applying rules across collections, PIN codes, and user groups, along with enabling **Partial COD**.

## COD Filtering Options

You can filter COD availability using different rules:

- **Filter by Collections**  
  - Block COD orders for products under specific collections.  
  - Useful for categories with high RTO risk (e.g., fast fashion, seasonal items).  
  - Manage collections directly or browse/search to assign.  

- **Filter by PIN Codes**  
  - Restrict COD for specific regions.  
  - Upload a CSV of allowed/restricted PIN codes.  
  - Helps reduce risk from unreliable logistics areas.  

- **Filter by Users**

  - Limit COD availability for certain users.  
  - Useful for blocking repeat abusers or high-risk profiles.  
  - CSV upload supported for user lists.

## Partial COD

Partial COD helps reduce RTO losses by requiring a part of the order to be prepaid before the COD balance is collected.

- **Enable Partial COD**: Toggle to activate.  
- **Minimum Order Value**: Apply Partial COD only on orders above a set amount.  
- **Partial Amount Percentage**: Define what portion customers must prepay.  

### Charging Options:
1. **Charge only COD amount** – Collect a token advance tied to COD.  
2. **Charge a fixed amount** – Flat charge regardless of order value.  
3. **Charge % of order value (excluding COD charges)** – Prepaid portion based on subtotal.  
4. **Charge % of order value (including COD charges)** – Prepaid portion including COD fee.

## Why Use COD Rules?

By combining filters and Partial COD, you can:  
- Reduce **fraudulent or fake COD orders**.  
- Improve **cash flow** with partial upfront payments.  
- Lower **logistics costs** by avoiding high-risk deliveries.  
- Retain COD convenience while balancing risk.
