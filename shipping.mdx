# Shipping and Delivery

The **Shipping and Delivery** section in FlexyPe allows you to configure shipping zones, delivery rates, Cash on Delivery (COD) options, and non-serviceable PIN codes. All shipping settings can be synced directly from Shopify, ensuring consistency across both platforms.

---

## Step 1: Open Shipping

When you click **Shipping** in the left navigation menu, you’ll see your shipping profiles. From here you can either sync settings from Shopify or start adding your own zones.  

The **Add Shipping Zone** button in the top-right allows you to create new zones.

## Step 2: View Shipping Zones

Inside a shipping profile (for example, *General Profile*), you’ll see existing zones such as **Domestic** and **International**.  

Each zone shows:  
- **Rate name** (e.g., Standard, Express)  
- **Estimated delivery time**  
- **Price range covered**  
- **COD status** (Active/Inactive)  
- **Actions** (edit, delete, toggle active)

## Step 3: Create a Shipping Zone

Click **Add Shipping Zone** to define a new zone.  

You can:  
- Enter a **Zone Name** (internal only).  
- Choose between:  
  - **State & Country based** zones  
  - **Pincode based** zones  
- Select multiple countries, states, or enter postal codes.  

This lets you precisely control where your products can be delivered.

## Step 4: Edit Shipping Rates

By clicking the **pencil icon** under Actions, you can configure delivery rates for each zone.  

Available options include:  
- **Rate Name:** The label customers will see at checkout (e.g., Standard Delivery).  
- **Estimated Delivery Time:** Helps set clear expectations for customers.  
- **Rate Type:** Based on order price or order weight.  
- **Pricing Conditions:** Set minimum/maximum order ranges and define charges.  
- **COD Settings:** Enable Cash on Delivery and apply COD fees if needed.  
- **Non-serviceable PIN Codes:** Upload a CSV to block specific postal codes.

- Keep Shopify and FlexyPe fully synced.  
- Offer clear delivery timelines to customers.  
- Enable or restrict COD for specific zones.  
- Exclude high-risk or non-serviceable PIN codes.  

This ensures customers always see accurate, reliable delivery options and helps businesses avoid unnecessary shipping issues.
