## Key Data Shown
- **Checkout ID** – Unique identifier for each abandoned checkout.  
- **Email & Phone** – Customer contact information for follow-ups.  
- **Amount** – Value of the abandoned cart.  
- **Session State** – The stage where the customer dropped off (e.g., Address Page, Payment Page).  
- **Date Created** – Timestamp of when the cart was abandoned.  

## Why It Matters
Tracking abandonment helps you act quickly:  
- Trigger **automated reminder campaigns** with incentives.  
- Spot friction points in checkout (e.g., if many abandon on the Payment Page).  
- Recover high-intent buyers without additional ad spend.
