# Create Free Shipping Discount

The **Free Shipping Discount** allows you to offer free delivery to customers when certain conditions are met. This type of promotion is commonly used to encourage higher cart values and improve checkout conversions.  

---

## Step 1: Setup

The **Setup** section defines how the discount applies and whether it requires a coupon code or is automatic.

/>

**Options include:**  
- **Coupon Code:** Customers must enter the code at checkout (e.g., `FREEDEL`).  
- **Automatic Discount:** Applies automatically when conditions are met.  
- **Shipping Rates:** Optionally exclude shipping options that exceed a certain price threshold (e.g., free shipping only for rates below ₹200).  

---

## Step 2: Condition

The **Condition** section specifies purchase requirements before free shipping applies.

**Options include:**  
- **No Requirement:** Applies to all orders.  
- **Minimum/Maximum Purchase Amount:** Restrict free shipping to orders above or below a certain value.  
- **Minimum/Maximum Quantity of Items:** Apply free shipping only when the cart contains a set number of products.

## Step 3: User Eligibility

The **User Eligibility** section controls who can use the free shipping discount.

- **Specific Users:** Restrict to selected users.  
- **Order Specific Rules:**  
  - *All orders*  
  - *First order only*  
  - *Based on total order count*

## Step 4: Usage Limits

The **Usage Limits** section controls how many times the discount can be used.

- **Per Customer Limit:** Restrict usage for individual customers.  
- **Combine with Other Discounts:** Allow stacking with other active coupons.  
- **Discount Active Period:** Set start and optional end dates.  
- **Disable COD:** Prevent Cash on Delivery when free shipping is applied.

## Step 5: Preview

The **Preview** section determines how the free shipping discount is displayed to customers.

**Options include:**  
- **Coupon Visibility:** Show or hide the coupon during checkout.

- Increase cart value by setting minimum order thresholds.  
- Improve customer satisfaction by reducing checkout friction.  
- Run targeted promotions for specific users or products.
