# Create Purchase Driven Coupon

The **Purchase Driven Coupon** allows you to target customers based on their purchase history or behavior. Unlike general discounts, these coupons are applied only when customers meet specific behavioral criteria such as having made a minimum number of purchases, reaching a spend threshold, or using a previous coupon code.  

This type of coupon is useful for loyalty programs, retention campaigns, or rewarding frequent buyers.  

---

## Step 1: Setup

The **Setup** section determines how the discount applies and what value it carries.

  alt="Setup section"
/>

**Options include:**  
- **How the discount applies:**  
  - *Coupon Code* – Requires the customer to enter a code at checkout.  
  - *Automatic Discount* – Applies automatically in cart and checkout.  
- **Discount Value:**  
  - *Percentage off* – e.g., 5% off.  
  - *Fixed amount* – e.g., ₹500 off.  
- **Maximum Cap:** Set an upper limit on the total discount that can be applied.  

---

## Step 2: User Behavior

The **User Behavior** section is unique to this coupon type. It specifies the conditions that must be met in past purchases.

  alt="User behavior section"
/>

**Options include:**  
- **Behavior Period:** Define a date range (start and optional end date). Only purchases within this period are considered.  
- **Customer Behavior Conditions:**  
  - *Use Coupon Code* – Restrict to customers who previously used a specific coupon (e.g., `WELCOME10`).  
  - *Minimum Order Amount* – Restrict to customers who previously made purchases above a set threshold.  
  - *Minimum Number of Orders* – Restrict to customers with at least a defined number of past orders.  

These rules allow precise targeting of loyal or high-value customers.

## Step 3: Condition

The **Condition** section works like other discounts, defining the purchase requirements for applying the coupon.

  alt="Condition section"
/>

Options include:  
- No purchase requirement  
- Minimum/maximum purchase amount  
- Minimum/maximum quantity of items  
- Apply to: entire cart, specific products, or collections

## Step 4: User Eligibility

The **User Eligibility** section is the same as other coupon types.

  src="/images/coupons/PurchaseDriven/image3.png"
  alt="User eligibility section"
/>

Options include:  
- *All users* or *specific users only*  
- *All orders*, *first order only*, or based on *total order count*  

---

## Step 5: Usage Limits

The **Usage Limits** section defines how often the coupon can be used.  

<img
  className="rounded-lg"
  src="/images/coupons/PurchaseDriven/image4.png"
  alt="Usage limits section"
/>

Options include:  
- Maximum number of uses overall  
- Maximum number of uses per customer  
- Allow combining with other discounts  
- Define start/end active dates  
- Optionally disable COD for this discount  

---

## Step 6: Preview

The **Preview** section controls how the coupon appears to customers.  

<img
  className="rounded-lg"
  src="/images/coupons/PurchaseDriven/image5.png"
  alt="Preview section"
/>

Options include:  
- Show or hide coupon visibility at checkout  
- Add a **custom title and details** for clarity  

---

## Why It Matters

Purchase Driven Coupons allow you to reward customer loyalty and design highly targeted campaigns. By linking discounts to customer history, you can:  
- Encourage repeat purchases.  
- Incentivize higher-value transactions.  
- Build personalized loyalty programs.  

This approach ensures that discounts are used strategically, targeting the right customers without unnecessary margin loss.
