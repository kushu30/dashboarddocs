# Create Freebie Coupon

The **Freebie Coupon** allows you to add specific products to a customer’s cart free of cost when the coupon conditions are met. This type of promotion is commonly used for “Free Gift with Purchase” campaigns and can be combined with other discounts while ensuring the free item is excluded from overlapping coupons.

## Step 1: Setup

The **Setup** section defines how the coupon is applied and which product is given away as a freebie.

**Options include:**  
- **How the discount applies:**  
  - *Coupon Code* – Customer enters a code at checkout.  
  - *Automatic Discount* – Freebie is automatically added.  
- **Discount Code:** Example – `FREEGIFT`.  
- **Products to Add:** Choose specific products or variants to give away as free items.  
- **Free Quantity:** Define how many free units of the product will be given.  
- **Exclusions:** Free products are not counted in any other coupon, even if this coupon is combinable.

## Step 2: Condition

The **Condition** section specifies when the freebie coupon is applied.

**Options include:**  
- **No Requirement:** Coupon can be applied to any order.  
- **Purchase Amount:** Coupon applies only if total cart value meets a minimum or maximum threshold.  
- **Purchase Quantity:** Coupon applies only if total cart items meet a minimum or maximum threshold.

## Step 3: User Eligibility

The **User Eligibility** section works the same way as other coupon types.

**Options include:**

- **Order Specific Rules:**  
  - *All orders*  
  - *First order only*  
  - *Based on total order count*

## Step 4: Usage Limits

The **Usage Limits** section controls how often the freebie coupon can be redeemed.

  alt="Usage limits section"

**Options include:**  
- **Total Usage Limit:** Maximum number of times the coupon can be used overall.  
- **Per Customer Limit:** Restrict how many times a single customer can use the coupon.  
- **Combine with Other Discounts:** Decide if this coupon can be combined with other offers.  
- **Active Period:** Set a start and optional end date for the coupon validity.  
- **Disable COD:** Restrict Cash on Delivery for this coupon if needed.

## Why It Matters

Freebie Coupons are highly effective in:  
- Increasing cart size by encouraging customers to qualify for a free gift.  
- Driving sales of specific products by pairing them with freebies.  
- Running seasonal promotions (e.g., “Free Mug with Orders Above ₹999”).  

By carefully setting conditions and usage limits, businesses can use freebies as a powerful incentive while keeping promotions sustainable.
