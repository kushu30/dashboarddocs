# Create Bundle Discount Coupon

The **Bundle Discount Coupon** allows you to create promotions where customers receive special pricing when purchasing multiple products together. This type of discount is useful for product bundles, upsells, or incentivizing customers to purchase higher quantities.

## Step 1: Setup

The **Setup** section defines how the coupon is applied and what discount value is offered.

  alt="Setup section"
/>

**Options include:**  
- **How the discount applies:**  
  - *Coupon Code* – Customer enters a code at checkout.  
  - *Automatic Discount* – Discount applies automatically.  
- **Discount Code Example:** `BUNDLEBUY`.  
- **Discount Types:**  
  - *Fixed Bundle Price* – e.g., “2 items for ₹1499.”  
  - *Fixed Amount Off* – Deduct a set value from the total.  
  - *Percentage Off* – Deduct a percentage from the total price.  
- **Applies To:**  
  - *Specific Products* – Discount only applies to selected items.  
  - *Specific Collections* – Discount applies to an entire collection.  
- **Quantity Limit:** Restrict the number of items eligible under the bundle. Once the specified quantity is reached, the discount no longer applies.

## Step 2: Condition

The **Condition** section specifies purchase requirements before the bundle discount applies.

**Options include:**  
- **No Requirement:** Applies to any order.  
- **Minimum/Maximum Purchase Amount:** Restrict the discount to certain cart totals.  
- **Minimum/Maximum Quantity of Items:** Restrict to specific cart sizes.

## Step 3: User Eligibility

The **User Eligibility** section defines which customers can access the bundle discount.

**Options include:**  
- **All Users:** Discount is available for everyone.  
- **Specific Users:** Restrict the discount to selected customers.  
- **Order Specific:**  
  - *All orders*  
  - *First order only*  
  - *Based on total order count*

## Step 4: Usage Limits

The **Usage Limits** section controls how often the bundle discount can be applied.

**Options include:**  
- **Global Usage Limit:** Maximum times the coupon can be used.  
- **Per Customer Limit:** Restrict use per individual.  
- **Combine with Other Discounts:** Allow or disallow stacking with other promotions.  
- **Discount Active Period:** Define start and end date/time.  
- **Disable COD:** Optionally restrict Cash on Delivery when using this coupon.

## Step 5: Preview

The **Preview** section controls how the coupon appears to customers.

  src="/images/coupons/Bundle/image4.png"
  alt="Preview section"
/>

**Options include:**  
- **Coupon Visibility:** Decide whether the coupon is shown during checkout.  
- **Custom Title and Details:** Add a descriptive title and explanation for clarity (e.g., *“Get 2 products for ₹1499”*).

## Why It Matters

Bundle discounts help businesses:  
- Increase average order value by encouraging customers to buy more items together.  
- Promote specific products or collections.  
- Run seasonal or promotional campaigns (e.g., “Buy 2 Hoodies for ₹1499”).  

With precise controls on eligibility, limits, and visibility, FlexyPe makes it simple to configure bundle offers that boost sales without reducing margins unnecessarily.
