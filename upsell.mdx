# Upsell

The **Upsell** feature allows you to increase average order value by showcasing additional products or collections to customers during checkout. By presenting relevant offers at the right time, you can drive incremental sales without increasing traffic acquisition costs.

## Step 1: Add Upsell Products

Click **Add Products** on the top-right to configure upsells for individual items.

  alt="Add upsell products"
/>

**Options include:**  
- Select specific products from your catalog.  
- Choose which variants are included.  
- Toggle status to activate or deactivate.  

This is useful for recommending **complementary products**.  
*Example: Suggest a “Protein Shaker” when a customer adds “Whey Protein” to their cart.*

## Step 2: Add Upsell Collections

Instead of individual products, you can upsell entire collections.

/>

**Options include:**  
- Select full collections such as “Winter Essentials” or “Accessories.”  
- All products within the collection are automatically included.  
- Manage upsell availability at the collection level.  

This is effective for **seasonal promotions** or **category-based campaigns**.  
*Example: Offer the “Ski Gear Collection” when a customer buys “Ski Wax.”*

## Step 3: Customer Checkout View

Once configured, upsell offers appear directly to customers at checkout.

  alt="Upsell checkout view"
/>

Customers will see:  
- Recommended products or collections displayed alongside their cart.  
- Pricing, availability, and an option to quickly add upsell items.  
- A seamless experience where upsells don’t disrupt the checkout flow.  

This ensures upsells feel like **helpful suggestions** rather than interruptions.  

---

## Why It Matters

Upsells help you:  
- Boost **average order value** with minimal effort.  
- Promote **relevant add-ons or premium upgrades.**  
- Clear **excess stock** by pairing slow movers with popular items.  
- Increase **customer satisfaction** with meaningful recommendations.  

By combining product-level and collection-level upsells, you can create tailored offers that maximize both customer experience and revenue.
