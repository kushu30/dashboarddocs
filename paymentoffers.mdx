# Payment Offers

The **Payment Offers** feature lets you incentivize customers to choose specific payment methods at checkout. For example, offering 10% off on prepaid transactions, or discounts for UPI, wallets, or debit/credit card payments.  

This helps merchants encourage digital payments, reduce COD reliance, and partner with financial institutions for promotional campaigns.

- Promoting digital and prepaid payments over COD.  
- Partnering with banks, wallets, and payment providers for campaigns.  
- Offering flexibility by tailoring discounts per payment method.  
- Improving checkout conversions with clear incentives.  

By configuring Payment Offers, businesses can reduce cash handling risks, lower COD return rates, and align promotions with their payment strategy.
